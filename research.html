                                <p>Using a digitized sample of thousands of essays written by 11-year-olds in 1969,
                                    we construct an index which measures the extent to which girls’ imagined futures
                                    conform to gender norms in Britain at the time. We link this index to outcomes
                                    over the life-cycle. Conditional on a large set of age-11 covariates, a one standard
                                    deviation increase in our index is associated with a decrease in lifetime earnings of
                                    3.5%, due to both lower wages and fewer hours worked. Half of this earnings decline
                                    is mediated by reduced educational attainment, selection into lower-paid occupations,
                                    and earlier family formation of those who conform more strongly to prevalent gender
                                    norms. Holding skills constant, girls whose essays conform less to gender norms, live
                                    in regions with higher female employment and educational attainment. This highlights
                                    that the wider environment in which girls grow up shapes gender conformity.</p>

                                <p>U.S. employers and the federal government devote over 1.5% of GDP annually
                                    toward promoting defined contribution (DC) retirement saving. Using a new employer–
                                    employee linked dataset covering millions of Americans, we show that this system of
                                    saving incentives benefits White workers and those with richer parents more than their
                                    similar-income coworkers who are Black or Hispanic or from lower-income families.
                                    Breaking the link between contribution choices and saving subsidies—through revenue neutral reforms—can close the gaps in DC wealth between Black and White workers,
                                    between Hispanic and White workers, and between those with the richest and those

                                    Exploiting panel data covering individuals from birth to retirement, 
                                    we estimate child skill production functions and embed them into an estimated 
                                    dynastic model in which altruistic mothers and fathers make investments in their 
                                    children. We find that time investments, educational investments, and 
                                    assortative matching have a greater impact on generating inequality and 
                                    intergenerational persistence than cash transfers. While education subsidies 
                                    can reduce inequality, due to an estimated dynamic complementarity between 
                                    time investments and education, it is crucial to announce them in advance to 
                                    allow parents to adjust their investments when their children are young.</p>

                                    age by exploiting Poland's switch from a Defined Benefit to a Notional Defined Contribution
                                    scheme for men born after 1948. Using the universe of taxpayers and this sharp cohort-based
                                    discontinuity in the link between current contributions and future benefits, we estimate an
                                    employment elasticity with respect to the return to work of 0.44 for ages 51-54. We estimate a

                                <p>How do education, skills, investments of parental time and school quality, and family circumstances
                                    during childhood contribute to the persistence of earnings across generations? Building on a classic
                                    literature in sociology and a more recent literature in economics, our model allows each of the above
                                    variables to affect lifetime earnings directly, as well as through their contribution to human capital
                                    formation. The model allows us to decompose the intergenerational elasticity of earnings (IGE) into
                                    its drivers. Using data from a representative British cohort followed from birth to age 55, we show the
                                    above variables explain most of the IGE. A key driver is the increased levels of parental investments
                                    received by children of high income parents early in their lives, and the resulting cognitive development.</p>

                                <p>We analyze lifecycle saving using a recursive utility model 
                                    calibrated to match estimates of the value of a statistical 
                                    life. The novelty of our approach is that we require 
                                    preferences to be monotone with respect to first-order 
                                    stochastic dominance while disentangling risk aversion and 
                                    the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. We show that,

                                    Risk averse agents insure against early death by consuming

                                <p>Government pension spending in advanced economies can be divided into two types: (1) Social Security-
                                    style benefits that depend on working-life earnings and (2) means-tested old-age income floors. Spend-
                                    ing on the former type of benefit is substantially greater than spending on the latter in most countries.
                                    Using an estimated lifecycle model that accounts for these, as well as endogenous labor supply, private
                                    savings and realistic uncertainty, this paper investigates the optimal combination of the two types of
                                    pensions. For countries that provide public pensions that depend on career-average earnings, I show
                                    that large (revenue-neutral) welfare gains can be obtained by increases in means-tested old-age income
                                    floors. While such transfers cause costly distortions, these are more than offset by the value of the
                                    insurance provided. The optimality of greater means-tested support is specific to older individuals: I
                                    find that such support to younger households should be much lower. These results imply that govern-
                                    ments should provide strong work incentives for the young, but provide pensions with good insurance
                                    properties for the old.</p>

                                <p>The “annuity puzzle” refers to the fact that annuities 
                                    are rarely purchased despite the longevity insurance they provide. 
                                    Most explanations for this puzzle assume that individuals have accurate 
                                    expectations about their future survival. We provide evidence that 
                                    individuals misperceive their mortality risk and study the demand for 
                                    annuities in a setting where annuities are priced by insurers on the 
                                    basis of objectively-measured survival probabilities but in which individuals 
                                    make purchasing decisions based on their own subjective survival probabilities. 
                                    Subjective expectations have the capacity to explain significant rates of 
                                    nonannuitization, yielding a quantitatively important explanation for the 
                                    annuity puzzle.</p>

                                    In this chapter, we review this literature, with an emphasis on models of individual and
                                    household behavior. We first show how expectations data have been used to relax strong assumptions
                                    about beliefs and outline how they can be used in estimation to substitute for, or as a complement to, data

                                    combined with linked survey and administrative data on wealth and 
                                    lifetime earnings we evaluate measures of retirement preparedness. 
                                    We estimate heterogeneous discount factors for households and compare 
                                    these estimates of their patience to their replacement rates—the simple 
                                    measure often used to evaluate the adequacy of retirement savings. We 
                                    find first that the specification of the model's asset structure matters quantitatively 
                                    for preference parameter estimates—households appear to be much more patient 
                                    when they are assumed to have access only to a risk-free asset compared to when 
                                    we account for the fact that much of their wealth is stored in higher-return 
                                    tax-advantaged private pensions and in housing. Second, we find that only the 
                                    most patient households achieve the replacement rates out of final earnings 
                                    that are often recommended by policymakers and industry as sensible benchmarks 
                                    for retirement preparedness. Notwithstanding this, we find that even quite impatient 
                                    households in the population we study achieve high replacement rates out of 
                                    lifetime average income—a more sensible summary measure of preparedness for retirement.</p>

                                    income tend to spend much more than those with merely moderately low income. 
                                    This phenomenon is evident throughout three decades worth of microdata and across 
                                    different employment states, levels of education and marital statuses. Of 
                                    the likely explanations, we provide several arguments that discount over-reporting 
                                    of expenditure and argue that under-reporting of income plays the major role. 
                                    In particular, by using a dynamic model of consumption and saving, and 
                                    paying special attention to poverty dynamics,

                                that has been surprisingly difficult to answer. We use a new 
                                data set containing both individual survey data on wealth 
                                holdings and administrative data on earnings histories to examine

                        <p>We put forward a method for estimating discount rates using 
                            wealth and income data. We build consumption from these data 
                            using the budget constraint. Consumption transitions yield discount 
                            rates by household groups. Applying this technique to a sample of

                        <p>Government transfers to individuals are often given labels indicating that they are designed to support the
                            consumption of particular goods. Standard economic theory implies that the labeling of cash transfers or cash-
                            equivalents should have no effect on spending patterns. We study the UK Winter Fuel Payment, a cash transfer
                            to older households. Our empirical strategy nests a regression discontinuity design within an Engel curve 
                            framework. We find robust evidence of a behavioral effect of labeling. On average households spend 47% of the WFP on
                            fuel. If the payment were treated as cash, we would expect households to spend 3% of the payment on fuel.</p>

                            in each of the last three recessions in the UK. The ‘Great Recession’ has been different from
                            those that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. It has been both deeper and longer, but also
                            the composition of the cutbacks in expenditure differs, with a greater reliance on cuts to
                            nondurable expenditure than was seen in previous recessions, and the distributional pattern
                            across individuals differs. The young have cut back expenditure more than the old, as have
                            mortage holders compared to renters. By contrast, the impact of the recession has been
                            similar across education groups. We present evidence that suggests that two aspects of fiscal
                            policy in the UK in 2008 and 2009 – the temporary reduction in the rate of VAT and a
                            car scrappage scheme – had some success in encouraging households to increase durable

                            key economic outcomes as individuals move towards and through their retirement. We look at
                            whether differences in baseline numeracy (measured in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
                            in 2002) and broader cognitive ability predict the subsequent trajectories of outcomes such as
                            wealth, retirement income and key dimensions of retirement expectations. Those with lower
                            numeracy are shown to have different wealth trajectories both pre- and post-retirement than their
                            more numerate counterparts, but the distributions of retirement expectations and net replacement
                            rates are similar across numeracy groups.</p>

                        <p>For many years, survey data on household wealth have been somewhat limited,
                            but the situation is improving in the UK and internationally. This paper uses
                            the new Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) to document some key features
                            of the distribution of household wealth in Great Britain. We quantify the
                            extent of inequality in total wealth and in its broad components (financial
                            wealth, housing wealth and pension wealth). Exploiting the fact that WAS is
                            a longitudinal survey, we show trajectories of wealth and its components over 
                            the period 2006 to 2012 for different birth cohorts. Total wealth on average
                            increased in real terms over this period for working-age households and fell
                            for retirement-age households. However, wealth held outside pensions fell on
                            average over this period for all except the youngest cohort.</p>
